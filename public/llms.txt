# HackedServer

HackedServer is a premium Minecraft plugin that detects hacked clients, cheats, and unwanted mods as players connect to your server. It uses advanced packet-based checks at connection time so you can catch cheaters early and keep your community fair.

## Overview

HackedServer helps Minecraft server owners automatically detect players using suspicious clients and mods (Forge, Fabric, WorldDownloader, Labymod, Vape Cracked, and more depending on version). It runs lightweight checks at join time, logs detections, and can alert staff or run automatic punishments.

## Product & Features

- **Early detection**: Run checks when players connect, before they can toggle cheats.
- **Wide client coverage**: Detect many popular hacked clients and mod loaders.
- **Automatic alerts & actions**: Notify staff or trigger custom punishments.
- **Proxy support**: Works with Bungeecord-style setups when installed on both backend servers and proxy.
- **Extensible checks**: Add your own custom checks for special use cases.

## How it works

1. Install HackedServer, HackedCore, and (for 1.17+) ProtocolLib on your Spigot/Paper servers.
2. Configure detection rules and actions in the plugin configuration.
3. (For Bungeecord/Waterfall) Install HackedServer on the proxy as well and enable the relevant options.
4. Monitor alerts, logs, and automated actions as players join.
