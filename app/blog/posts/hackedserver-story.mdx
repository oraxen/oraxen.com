# The Story Behind HackedServer

HackedServer is not just a plugin, it's also a story that has been going on for a long time.  
If it does not interest you, feel free to leave this page — from here you will not find any more useful information.

It all started 4 years ago, in 2015. I was 13 years old and a friend introduced me to Minecraft.  
Like many, I ended up falling in love with the game and I decided to open my own server.  
After a few weeks of work and patience I started having about twenty active players: it was a lot to manage for me because I had to configure the plugins and find money to pay for hosting.  
I made the decision to hire moderators and focus on the rest. In the end it worked pretty well and it gave me time to promote the project and start learning Java.

### July 2016

The server has more than a year of life behind it but unfortunately the shop did not yield much money and I could barely pay the hosting.  
At the same time a competing server tried to copy me and steal my small community — they even managed to steal our spawn using WorldDownloader.  
To make things worse a scandal hit: I discovered that the biggest players on my server were using a minimap mod to find the bases of their opponents and see their enemies through blocks!

I hesitated to give up, but in the end I decided to try something first.  
It took me a long time but with the help of a friend, that I could probably never thank enough, I managed to find a way to detect Forge mods: it was a golden opportunity to put into practice the basics of Java that I had acquired.

After a few days a first prototype gave me conclusive results and encouraged me to improve it to make its use more ergonomic.  
That's how the first version of HackedServer was born — and of course this nightmare for hacked clients, hacking advanced Forge features had to be called **HackedServer**, haha.  
Associated with a free anticheat and without changing the moderation team, the number of cheaters decreased very quickly and there were almost none left after a week.

### January 2017

The competing server went bankrupt: it could no longer copy our buildings so we did our best to rebuild everything in the most beautiful way.  
Thanks to all our efforts their only remaining players were the cheaters banished from our server. It was a huge victory for me!

### December 2017

My server now has thousands of registered players and I improved HackedServer enormously: it is no longer content to detect only Forge mods, it can now detect many other mods and cheats.  
A few months before, I posted HackedServer on Spigot so that no one would have to experience the same moments of doubt as me.  
The feedback from the community was really enthusiastic; they helped and encouraged me so much to continue! **THANK YOU WITH ALL MY ❤️**

### June 2019

The plugin continued to work well and managed to overcome big difficulties (like the incompatibility with Bungeecord).  
The code was almost completely redone (and I must say that if I did not like at all the code of the first versions, I am rather proud of this one: I progressed a lot in Java).  
I thought it was time to gather the community around a small website as documentation and a Discord — do not hesitate to give me your opinion!
