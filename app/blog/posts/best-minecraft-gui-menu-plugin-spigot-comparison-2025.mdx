### CommandPanels: Advanced Logic and Animation

CommandPanels is the go-to for sophisticated customization, supporting complex animations and interactive logic. It works on Minecraft versions from 1.8 all the way to 1.21, and its 277 reviews show a strong, dedicated following.

**Strengths:**
- Modern codebase optimized for recent game updates
- Support for creating unlimited menus
- Customization that goes beyond what DeluxeMenus offers
- Active development that keeps it current

**Limitations:**

## Implementation and Performance Considerations

Each of these plugins handles resources differently. The advanced features in CommandPanels can impact performance on servers with limited hardware, while DeluxeMenus offers very predictable resource usage. zMenu strikes a good balance, providing modern features that are optimized for recent Minecraft versions.

Think about your server's typical player count, available resources, and your own technical comfort level when deciding. Whatever you choose, always test your configurations on a separate development server before rolling them out to your players.

## What to Do Next

Ultimately, the best GUI menu plugin is the one that fits your server's goals and your comfort level. CommandPanels is the powerhouse for deep customization, zMenu is the modern up-and-comer, and DeluxeMenus is the reliable workhorse.
