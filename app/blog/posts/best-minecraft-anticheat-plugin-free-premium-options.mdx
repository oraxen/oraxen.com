## Which Minecraft Plugin Anticheat Works with Bedrock Edition?

If your server supports both Java and Bedrock players, **Spartan Anti Cheat** is one of the most comprehensive solutions available. It's been downloaded over 94,000 times and supports game versions from 1.7 to 1.20. It also offers:

- **Full support for Bedrock/Geyser** on cross-platform servers.
- **Flexible punishment options,** from simple warnings to automatic bans.
- **Easy-to-use in-game menus** for configuration and adjustments.
- **Compatibility with nearly every** active version of the game.

For another free option, **Themis Anti Cheat** also has real Bedrock support and is built for accuracy and efficiency on small to medium-sized servers.

## Should I Use Multiple Anticheat Plugins Together?

Yes, you can get better protection against sophisticated Java hacks by combining a primary anticheat with a secondary detection tool. The recommended approach is:

**Primary:** Use Grim Anticheat or Spartan as your main line of defense.
**Secondary:** Add BetterAnticheat as a lightweight, platform-independent tool to back it up.

This layered strategy helps you catch a wider variety of cheats without hurting server performance. BetterAnticheat is designed specifically to be a secondary tool, expanding your detection capabilities without causing conflicts with your primary system.

## What Are the System Requirements for Modern Anticheat Plugins?

Most modern anticheat tools, including Grim and Themis, will require:

- **Java 17 or higher** for optimal performance and security.
- **Paper, Spigot, or Folia** server software (Bukkit support varies).
- **Adequate RAM allocation** for asynchronous processing.
- **Regular updates** to maintain effectiveness against new exploits.

Meeting these requirements ensures your chosen tool can handle modern hacking techniques while keeping your server stable.
