Administrators of modded Minecraft environments can find it tricky to balance Forge mod functionality with essential management tools. This guide points you to the most effective Spigot plugins that complement a Forge setup, providing crucial administration, protection, and performance features without conflicting with your mod ecosystem.

## Essential Administration Plugins for Forge Servers

### EssentialsX: Complete Server Foundation
EssentialsX is the go-to all-in-one plugin, providing hundreds of commands including moderation, teleportation, kits, and economy features. On a Forge installation, EssentialsX handles player management tasks that mods don't usually address, creating a comprehensive administrative foundation.

### LuckPerms: Advanced Permission Management
LuckPerms offers a leading permissions system with a web interface for managing ranks and fine-grained permission control across worlds. This becomes particularly valuable on modded worlds where different player groups may need access to specific mod features or commands.

## World Management and Protection Tools

### Multiverse-Core and WorldGuard Integration
Multiverse-Core enables you to run multiple worlds on a single server, allowing admins to create, remove, and manage them easily. Combined with WorldGuard, which protects regions by allowing rules such as denying building, disabling PVP, and blocking TNT explosions, these plugins create robust world management capabilities that work alongside Forge mods.

### CoreProtect: Comprehensive Action Logging
CoreProtect logs all player actions and allows admins to roll back damage, which is essential for grief protection and management. This becomes critical in a modded environment where players have access to powerful tools and machines that can cause significant world changes.

## Performance and Compatibility Solutions

### Version Compatibility with ViaVersion
ViaVersion allows players to connect to your world from different Minecraft client versions, increasing accessibility. This flexibility proves valuable when running a Forge-based game, as it accommodates players who may be using different mod pack versions.

### Performance Optimization Tools
- **Let Me Despawn** optimizes performance by culling mobs that prevent players from sleeping and reduces entity lag.
- **ClearLagg**, with over 1.3 million downloads, is widely used to boost performance by limiting entities and managing lag.

These performance plugins become essential for modded gameplay where additional entities and processes can strain your resources.

## Building and Creative Tools

### WorldEdit for Large-Scale Construction
WorldEdit provides powerful building tools that allow you to select and modify large areas of blocks to speed up construction. This plugin complements building-focused mods by offering server-side editing capabilities that work consistently across all players.

## Implementation Best Practices

### Plugin Compatibility Considerations
Spigot, Bukkit, and CraftBukkit plugins are all compatible with the Spigot software and can be used interchangeably. When running a hybrid Forge environment, ensure your plugin selection doesn't conflict with core mod functionality.

### Safe Update Procedures
- Use the 'update' folder in the plugins directory to safely update multiple plugins at once without taking the server offline.
- Always back up your world folders, configurations, and plugin files before updating the game or any plugins.
