For server administrators, branding a Minecraft world is key, but the technical side of adding a custom icon can be a real hurdle. This guide breaks down the exact specs and steps you need to get your icon showing up perfectly in the multiplayer list. A great icon makes a professional first impression and can be what convinces a player to log in.

## Minecraft Server Icon Requirements

For your icon to show up correctly, it needs to meet a few strict requirements:

- **Dimensions**: Exactly 64x64 pixels
- **Format**: PNG file type only
- **Filename**: Must be named `server-icon.png` (case-sensitive)
- **Location**: Root/main directory of your server files

Before you upload, double-check your image's properties to make sure it's 64x64 pixels. If it's the wrong size, a simple tool like imageresizer.com can adjust it in seconds.

## Step-by-Step Installation Process

### 1. Prepare Your Icon File
- Create or resize your image to be exactly 64x64 pixels.
- Save it in PNG format.
- Rename the file to `server-icon.png`.

### 2. Upload to Server Directory
Place the `server-icon.png` file into your server's main directory. This is the same root folder where you'll find:
- `server.properties`
- `plugins` folder
- `world` folders

### 3. Restart Your Server
For the new icon to appear, you have to do a full restart. Simply reloading or using the `/reload` command won't work.

## Essential Plugin Setup for Enhanced Servers

A sharp icon gets players in the door, but well-configured plugins are what make them stay. When you restart a Paper server, it automatically loads any JAR files you've placed in the `plugins` folder.

When adding new plugins, keep these tips in mind:
- Download from trusted sources like Hangar.papermc.io, SpigotMC, or BukkitDev.
- If `/plugins` shows a red status, check `latest.log` for errors.
- Remember that plugins have full access to your server, so verifying their source is critical.

This is especially true for specialized game modes like prison, where the right mix of plugins is what creates a compelling experience from the ground up.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Icon not appearing**: Go back and check the requirements. Is the file *exactly* 64x64 pixels, saved as a PNG, and named `server-icon.png`? Is it in the root directory?

**Plugin errors**: Dive into your `latest.log` file. It will usually tell you if you're missing a dependency or if two plugins aren't playing nicely together.

**Performance issues**: Keep an eye on performance as you add more plugins. Each one consumes resources, so too many can slow things down.

## Next Steps for Server Enhancement

Getting your server icon set up is a great first step toward building a polished, professional Minecraft community. While the icon creates the brand, it's the plugins that define the gameplay and keep players coming back for more.
