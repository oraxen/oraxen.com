A custom Minecraft server icon is a great way to help players spot your server in their multiplayer list. However, getting it to work can be tricky due to some very specific technical requirements. This guide will walk you through the exact specifications and step-by-step process to successfully add a Minecraft server icon that displays correctly for everyone.

## Technical Requirements for Minecraft Server Icons

For your Minecraft server icon to show up, it has to meet some precise requirements. The image itself must be a 64x64 pixel PNG file. It also needs to be named *exactly* "server-icon.png", all in lowercase with a hyphen. Minecraft added this feature back in version 1.7.10 to make it easier for players to tell servers apart in their multiplayer list.

The naming format is crucial. If you use spaces or capital letters, the game won't recognize the file. To ensure it works, always stick to the "server-icon.png" format.

## Step-by-Step Installation Process

Here's how to add your server icon, step by step:

**Preparation Steps:**
- Create or resize your image to be 64x64 pixels. You can use free software like GIMP or an online tool like picresize.
- Save the image as "server-icon.png" in the PNG format.
- Before you do anything else, make sure your server is completely stopped.

**File Upload Process:**
- Navigate to your server's root directory (the one containing your `server.jar` and world folders).
- If there's already a `server-icon.png` file, delete it to avoid any issues.
- Upload your new `server-icon.png` file into this root directory.
- If you're with a hosting provider, you can usually do this through the File Manager or FTP access in your control panel.

**Activation:**
- Restart your server to make the changes take effect.
- Your new icon should now appear in the multiplayer list for anyone who adds your server.

## Troubleshooting Common Icon Issues

If your Minecraft server icon isn't showing up, check for these common problems:

**File Specification Problems:**
- **Image Size:** Is the image *exactly* 64x64 pixels? Even a single pixel off, like 65x65, will cause it to fail.
- **File Format:** Make sure you saved it as a PNG, not a JPG or something else.
- **Filename:** Double-check that the name is precisely "server-icon.png," with no typos or capital letters.

**Upload and Directory Issues:**
- **Location:** Is the file in the main server directory, not tucked away in a subfolder?
- **Old Files:** Did you remember to delete the old icon before uploading the new one?
- **Restart:** Have you restarted the server since you uploaded the file?

It's always a good idea to use image editing software or an online tool to double-check the dimensions before uploading. Incorrect sizing is the number one reason these icons fail to appear.

## Next Steps for Server Customization

Getting your Minecraft server icon to work is a great first step in making your server look more professional. With your icon now showing up in players' server lists, you can move on to other improvements like configuring plugins, customizing your world, and optimizing performance.
