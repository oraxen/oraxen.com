# Detecting Hacked Clients at Connection Time

Running a public Minecraft server means dealing with cheaters, hacked clients and unfair mods.  
**HackedServer** is built to catch them as early as possible: at the moment they connect.

## Why detect at connection time?

Instead of relying only on classic in-game anticheats, HackedServer inspects specific packets exchanged when the player joins.  
This allows it to:

- Detect many clients before they have time to toggle any cheat
- Reduce noise for your staff (fewer false-positives from movement checks)
- Give you a clear list of suspicious clients and mods

## What can HackedServer detect?

Depending on your server version, HackedServer can detect:

- Forge and many Forge mods
- Fabric and Rift-based clients
- WorldDownloader
- Labymod, BetterSprintingMod, Liteloader
- 5ZigMod, PX Mod
- Vape Cracked and more

You can also add your own custom checks to extend detection as new clients appear.

## Getting started

1. Drop `HackedServer.jar`, `HackedCore.jar` and (for 1.17+) `ProtocolLib` into your `/plugins/` folder.  
2. Restart your server.  
3. Follow the configuration guide in the docs.

You can read the full installation guide at [`https://docs.hackedserver.org`](https://docs.hackedserver.org).

That's it! This is a minimal example to get you started.
