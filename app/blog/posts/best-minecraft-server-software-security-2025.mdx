Your choice of server software affects how well anti-cheat plugins work. Some servers handle packet-level detection better than others, and performance directly impacts detection accuracy.

This guide compares server software options from a security perspective.

## Why Server Software Matters for Security

Anti-cheat plugins like HackedServer work by analyzing player packets and behavior. The server software you choose affects:

- **Packet handling speed** - Faster processing means more accurate detection
- **TPS stability** - Lag causes false positives in movement checks
- **Plugin compatibility** - Some anti-cheats need specific APIs
- **Exploit fixes** - Patched servers close attack vectors

## Recommended: Paper

[Paper](https://mcserverjars.com/paper) is the best choice for servers running anti-cheat plugins. It provides:

### Performance Benefits

Paper handles packets more efficiently than Spigot or Vanilla. This matters for anti-cheats that analyze movement and combat at the packet level.

Higher TPS means:
- Fewer false positives from lag
- More accurate reach and speed detection
- Better handling of player data

### Security Patches

Paper fixes many Minecraft exploits that cheaters can abuse:
- Chunk loading exploits
- Entity tracking issues
- Book and inventory exploits
- Duplication glitches

Running Paper means fewer attack surfaces for malicious clients.

### Plugin Support

Paper supports all Spigot plugins plus its own extended API. Anti-cheat plugins like HackedServer work perfectly on Paper servers.

## Alternative: Purpur

[Purpur](https://mcserverjars.com/purpur) is a Paper fork with additional features. For anti-cheat purposes, it performs identically to Paper.

Choose Purpur if you want extra configuration options for gameplay. For pure security focus, Paper is sufficient.

## Spigot

[Spigot](https://mcserverjars.com/spigot) works with most anti-cheat plugins but offers less performance than Paper. The lower TPS ceiling can lead to more false positives under load.

Use Spigot only if you have a specific compatibility requirement.

## Server Setup for Anti-Cheat

When setting up your server for HackedServer or other anti-cheat plugins:

### 1. Download Paper

Get the latest Paper build from [MCServerJars.com](https://mcserverjars.com/paper). Use the most recent Minecraft version for the best security patches.

### 2. Allocate Sufficient RAM

Anti-cheat plugins add minimal overhead, but maintaining high TPS is important:

| Players | Recommended RAM |
|---------|----------------|
| 1-20 | 4GB |
| 20-50 | 6GB |
| 50-100 | 8GB |
| 100+ | 12GB+ |

### 3. Install Dependencies

HackedServer requires:
- **ProtocolLib** - For Spigot/Paper servers
- **PacketEvents** - For Velocity proxies

### 4. Configure Properly

In your Paper configuration, avoid settings that reduce security:
- Keep online-mode true unless using a proxy
- Do not disable packet checks
- Use the latest protocol version

## Proxy Considerations

If you run a network with BungeeCord or Velocity:

### Velocity (Recommended)

[Velocity](https://mcserverjars.com/velocity) is the modern proxy choice. It is faster and more secure than BungeeCord.

HackedServer supports Velocity with the PacketEvents dependency.

### BungeeCord / Waterfall

[BungeeCord](https://mcserverjars.com/bungeecord) and [Waterfall](https://mcserverjars.com/waterfall) also work with HackedServer. Install the plugin on both the proxy and backend servers for full coverage.

## Performance Tips

To maximize anti-cheat accuracy:

1. **Maintain 19+ TPS** - Use Paper's timings to identify lag sources
2. **Limit view distance** - 8-10 chunks is usually sufficient
3. **Use async features** - Paper's async chunk loading helps
4. **Monitor with Spark** - Profile your server regularly

## Conclusion

For the best anti-cheat experience:

1. Use [Paper](https://mcserverjars.com/paper) or [Purpur](https://mcserverjars.com/purpur)
2. Keep your server updated
3. Allocate enough RAM for stable TPS
4. Install HackedServer from [hackedserver.org](https://hackedserver.org)

The combination of good server software and proper anti-cheat configuration will protect your community from cheaters effectively.
