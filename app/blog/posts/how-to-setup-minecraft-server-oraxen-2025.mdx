Setting up a Minecraft server for custom content requires the right foundation. This guide walks you through the entire process, from downloading your server software to configuring it for plugins like Oraxen.

## Choosing Your Server Software

Before installing any plugins, you need to choose the right server software. For custom items and resource packs, you want a server that supports plugins and handles resource pack distribution well.

### Recommended: Paper

[Paper](https://mcserverjars.com/paper) is the most popular choice for plugin servers. It offers excellent performance, full plugin compatibility, and active development.

Paper benefits for custom content servers:
- Fast chunk loading for large resource packs
- Optimized entity handling for custom mobs
- Full Bukkit and Spigot plugin support
- Regular updates and bug fixes

### Alternative: Purpur

If you want even more customization options, [Purpur](https://mcserverjars.com/purpur) extends Paper with additional configuration. It includes fun features and more control over game mechanics.

## Step 1: Download Your Server

Head to [MCServerJars.com](https://mcserverjars.com) to download the latest server jar. The site provides direct downloads for Paper, Spigot, Purpur, and other server software.

1. Go to [mcserverjars.com/paper](https://mcserverjars.com/paper)
2. Select your Minecraft version (latest stable recommended)
3. Download the server jar

## Step 2: Set Up Your Server

Create a new folder for your server and place the downloaded jar inside. Create a start script:

**Windows (start.bat):**
```
java -Xmx4G -Xms4G -jar server.jar --nogui
pause
```

**Linux/Mac (start.sh):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
java -Xmx4G -Xms4G -jar server.jar --nogui
```

Run the script once. It will generate files and ask you to accept the EULA. Open `eula.txt` and change `eula=false` to `eula=true`.

## Step 3: Configure for Custom Content

For servers running custom items and resource packs, optimize these settings:

### server.properties

```properties
# Allow custom resource packs
resource-pack=
resource-pack-sha1=
require-resource-pack=false

# Increase view distance if you have the resources
view-distance=10
simulation-distance=8
```

### paper-global.yml

Paper has options for resource pack handling. Oraxen will handle most of this automatically, but you can adjust timeouts if needed.

## Step 4: Install Required Plugins

For Oraxen, you need:

1. **CommandAPI** - Download from the [CommandAPI releases page](https://github.com/JorelAli/CommandAPI/releases)
2. **ProtocolLib** (optional but recommended) - Enhances packet handling

Place both in your `plugins` folder before adding Oraxen.

## Step 5: Add Oraxen

Download Oraxen and place it in your `plugins` folder. Restart the server.

Oraxen will generate its configuration files and start handling resource pack distribution. Check the console for the Polymath URL that players will use to download the pack.

## Server Hardware Recommendations

For a server with custom content:

| Players | RAM | CPU |
|---------|-----|-----|
| 1-10 | 4GB | 2 cores |
| 10-30 | 6GB | 4 cores |
| 30-50 | 8GB | 4+ cores |
| 50+ | 12GB+ | 6+ cores |

Custom items and resource packs add minimal overhead. Most of the work is done client-side after the pack downloads.

## Hosting Options

You can run your server on:
- **Home computer** - Free but requires port forwarding
- **VPS** - Full control, $5-20/month
- **Minecraft hosting** - Easy setup, $5-30/month

For production servers with custom content, a VPS or dedicated Minecraft host is recommended for reliable uptime.

## Next Steps

With your server running Paper and the prerequisites installed:

1. Install Oraxen from [Polymart](https://polymart.org/resource/oraxen.629) or [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/oraxen.72448/)
2. Check the [Oraxen documentation](https://docs.oraxen.com) for configuration
3. Create your first custom item

Your server is now ready for custom items, blocks, furniture, and armor with automatic resource pack generation.
