If you run a Minecraft world with plugins, a professional-looking icon is essential for attracting players and building your brand. This guide walks you through the specific requirements and steps to add a custom icon for your Minecraft server, making sure it shows up correctly in the multiplayer list.

## Icon Requirements and Specifications

For your icon to show up correctly, it must meet a few specific technical requirements:

- **Dimensions**: Exactly 64×64 pixels (this became standard with the 1.7.10 update).
- **File format**: Must be a PNG file to ensure it works across all server software.
- **File name**: It must be named exactly `server-icon.png`.
- **Location**: Place it in your server's main directory (the same folder as your `server.jar` file).

## Step-by-Step Installation Process

Follow these steps to add the icon for your Minecraft server:

1. **Prepare your image**: Resize your chosen image to exactly 64×64 pixels and save it as a PNG.
2. **Remove existing icons**: To avoid conflicts, delete any current `server-icon.png` file.
3. **Upload the file**: Move your new `server-icon.png` into the main server directory.
4. **Restart the server**: Stop and completely restart your Minecraft server for the new icon to load.
5. **Verify display**: Refresh the multiplayer list in your Minecraft client to confirm the icon appears.

## Integration with Plugin-Enhanced Servers

A good icon is a key part of the branding for a plugin-heavy server, giving it visual appeal before anyone even joins your world. As the PaperMC documentation notes, "Plugins are the most powerful way to extend the functionality of Paper beyond configuration files," and a professional-looking icon is the perfect companion to that enhanced experience.

The setup process is the same whether you use Paper, Bukkit, or Spigot plugins. This visual touch helps your feature-rich world stand out from more basic ones in the server browser.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your icon doesn't appear after following the installation steps, check these common problems:

- Confirm the file is exactly 64×64 pixels and is named `server-icon.png`.
- Verify the file is in the main server directory and not in a subfolder.
- Ensure you've restarted the server completely after adding the new file.
- Check that no other icon files exist that might be causing a conflict.
