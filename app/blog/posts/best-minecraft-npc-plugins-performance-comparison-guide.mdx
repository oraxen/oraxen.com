If you run a Minecraft server and want to bring your world to life with interactive non-player characters, you've got a lot of plugins to choose from. It can be tough to know which one is right, as they all have different features and performance impacts. This guide breaks down four of the most popular NPC plugins to help you decide.

## Performance-Focused Solutions

### FancyNpcs: Packet-Based Efficiency

FancyNpcs stands out with its packet-based system, built specifically for Paper. This approach makes it incredibly lightweight without cutting back on features. Its popularity, with over 156.5k downloads and 359 stars on Modrinth, shows it's a trusted choice for busy servers where every bit of performance counts.

By sending packets instead of spawning full entities, FancyNpcs puts less strain on your server. This makes it ideal for servers with lots of players or a high number of NPCs, helping to keep your tick rate stable. Being built for Paper also means it takes full advantage of modern performance optimizations.

### CustomNPCs: Streamlined Implementation

If you're looking for simplicity above all else, CustomNPCs is a great choice. It’s a lightweight plugin with broad compatibility for recent Minecraft versions like 1.20.x and 1.21.x. With 25.2k downloads and 83 stars, it’s clearly found its niche with server owners who want a straightforward way to add NPCs.

This plugin strikes a nice balance between performance and features. It gives you the essentials without the overwhelming complexity of the larger, more powerful options, all while staying compatible with the latest versions of Minecraft.

## Feature-Rich Platforms

### Citizens: Enterprise-Grade Capabilities

Citizens is the original powerhouse of NPC plugins, setting the standard for what's possible. It offers advanced behaviors, server-switching capabilities, and a deep API for developers to hook into. As Bukkit Projects puts it: "Citizens is the original Bukkit NPC plugin, adding everything from simple NPCs that talk to lively, active Denizens, Sentries, Traders and more."

This premium Spigot plugin is packed with robust tools for complex server networks. If you need sophisticated NPC interactions, scripted events, or cross-server features, Citizens has you covered.

### Characters: Modern Customization Framework

Characters is a modern plugin for Paper servers that focuses on easy, in-game customization. It also includes a developer-friendly API, making it both accessible for simple setups and flexible enough for custom projects.

## How to Choose the Right Plugin

**If performance is your top priority**: Go with FancyNpcs. Its packet-based system is perfect for busy Paper servers with lots of players or NPCs.

**If you need advanced features**: Citizens is your best bet. It’s the one to pick for complex behaviors, scripting, and large-scale server management.

**If you want something easy to use**: Try Characters. Its in-game editor makes setup a breeze, and it integrates smoothly with modern Paper servers.

**If you're on a tight resource budget**: CustomNPCs is an excellent lightweight option that covers the basics without slowing your server down.

## Implementation Recommendations

Before you pick a plugin, take a moment to think about your server's setup, how many NPCs you'll need, and how complex their behavior should be. If you're running Paper, you'll find that FancyNpcs and Characters are optimized for it. For Spigot users who need the most powerful tools available, Citizens is hard to beat.

And if you want to customize your server even more, think about adding other plugins to your toolkit. For example, the [Oraxen plugin](https://oraxen.com) makes it easy to add custom blocks and items. You can use it alongside your NPC plugin to create truly unique experiences that go way beyond default Minecraft.

Whatever you're leaning toward, it's always a good idea to check out the documentation, test the plugin on a development server, and see how active the community support is. This extra step will help you find a plugin that will work well with your server for a long time to come.
