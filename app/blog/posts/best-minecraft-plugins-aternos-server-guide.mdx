Getting your first Aternos Minecraft server running with plugins can feel overwhelming, especially when you aren't sure which tools will actually improve the experience for your players. This guide offers a curated list of essential plugins we've tested for Aternos compatibility. We'll also provide step-by-step instructions to help you sidestep common installation pitfalls and build a professional-grade server.

## Prerequisites: Setting Up Plugin Support on Aternos

Before you can add any plugins, you need to switch your server on Aternos to compatible software. Aternos needs software that can handle plugins—like Paper, Purpur, or Spigot—to run them on a Java server.

**Our recommendation:** Switch over to PaperMC for the best performance and compatibility. It’s better optimized and supports a wider range of plugins than standard Spigot.

To change your software:
1.  Access your Aternos server dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the **Software** section.
3.  Select **PaperMC** from the available options.
4.  Restart your server to apply the changes.

Once that's done, your installed plugins will show up on your server's "Plugins" page, ready for you to manage.

## An Essential Plugin Starter Pack for Your Aternos Server

### Core Administration: EssentialsX
EssentialsX gives you all the fundamental commands you need, like teleportation, setting homes, and basic moderation. It’s the bedrock of most servers and works perfectly with Aternos.

### Permissions Management: LuckPerms
LuckPerms gives you fine-grained control over player permissions and ranks. Its web editor makes even the most complex permission setups easy to handle, even for beginners.

### World Protection: WorldGuard + WorldEdit
Use WorldGuard to protect specific areas from griefing and WorldEdit for powerful admin building tools. They're a perfect pair for keeping your server safe while enabling massive creative projects.

### Economy Foundation: Vault
Think of Vault as the universal adapter for your server. It connects economy plugins to other tools, making features like paid teleports and shop systems possible.

## Advanced Customization with Oraxen

If you want to add custom items and blocks, [Oraxen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/oraxen.72448/) is a powerful tool for deep customization. This open-source plugin lets you create your own items, blocks, menus, and GUIs with unique textures and models. It even has an extensible API for more advanced setups.

Oraxen is especially great for servers aiming for a unique gameplay feel, giving you the tools to transform vanilla mechanics into something entirely new. You can also find the plugin on [Polymart](https://polymart.org/resource/oraxen.629), which gives server admins more ways to get it.

## Installation Best Practices and Troubleshooting

### Version Compatibility Checklist
- Always match the plugin version to your Minecraft server's version to prevent errors.
- Check for any required dependencies before you install.
- Make sure the plugin is compatible with your chosen software (Paper, Spigot, or Purpur).

### Configuration Management
Most plugins will create a configuration folder the first time your server starts. You can edit these files in the "Files" section of your Aternos dashboard. Just remember to restart the server for any changes to apply.

### Common Error Resolution
If a plugin won't load, your first stop should be the server logs at `logs/latest.log`. Any plugins listed in red are your problem children—this often points to a missing dependency or an incompatible JAR file. The log will show you the exact reason it failed, whether it's a missing dependency or an invalid `plugin.yml` file.

## Next Steps: Building Your Server Community

We recommend starting with the essential starter pack—EssentialsX, LuckPerms, WorldEdit, WorldGuard, and Vault—to get your core functionality in place. Once that foundation is solid, you can start exploring more specialized plugins that fit your server's unique theme.
