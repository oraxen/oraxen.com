## Technical Overview

This repository contains a Next.js application that provides the charting widget and the MCP server.

-   **MCP Server (`app/mcp/route.ts`)**: Exposes a `render_chart` tool that accepts chart parameters.
-   **Chart Widget (`app/chart/page.tsx`)**: A client page that renders a Recharts chart from `window.openai.toolOutput`.
-   **Host Integration (`app/layout.tsx`)**: Includes bootstrap scripts to ensure correct asset loading and navigation inside the ChatGPT iframe.
-   **CORS Middleware (`middleware.ts`)**: Handles cross-origin requests required for client-side navigation.

The `render_chart` tool returns `structuredContent` with fields like `chartType`, `data`, `xKey`, `yKey`, and other options, which the widget page consumes to render the visualization.
